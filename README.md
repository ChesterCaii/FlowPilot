# FlowPilot

An AI-powered incident response agent that automates on-call duties using AWS Bedrock, Temporal, and sponsor integrations.

## Overview

FlowPilot is a SaaS agent that "stands in" for your on-call engineer. It:

1. **Senses** CloudWatch alarms via webhook
2. **Reasons** via AWS Bedrock (Claude or Titan)
3. **Executes** remediation actions (pod restarts via kubectl or Block/Goose)
4. **Communicates** with multi-language reports (DeepL), diagrams, and voice alerts (Rime)

Built on Temporal for durable workflows and wrapped in MCP so the LLM can directly call out to sponsor tools.

## Key Features

- üß† **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Uses AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet) to decide whether to reboot or ignore alerts
- üîÑ **Automated Remediation**: Executes kubernetes commands to restart failing services
- üåé **Multi-Language Reports**: Automatically translates incident reports to French and German using DeepL
- üìä **Visual Incident Diagrams**: Generates system diagrams of affected components
- üîä **Voice Alerts**: Converts incident reports to voice alerts using Rime
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Durable Workflows**: Built on Temporal to ensure reliable execution even during failures
- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Dashboard**: Web UI to monitor incidents, view diagrams, and hear voice alerts

## Sponsor Integrations

- **Temporal**: Core workflow orchestration with durable execution and retries
- **AWS Bedrock**: AI decisioning using Claude 3 Sonnet model
- **DeepL**: Multi-language translation of incident reports
- **Block/Goose**: Secure command execution (simulated in development)
- **Rime**: Voice alert generation for audible notifications
- **MCP/guMCP Protocol**: Standardized agent-to-agent communication

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Temporal server (local dev or cloud)
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Sponsor API keys (see .env configuration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flowpilot.git
cd flowpilot
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on required variables:
```env
# AWS Bedrock Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0

# DeepL API for multi-language translation
DEEPL_API_KEY=your_deepl_api_key

# Rime for voice alerts
RIME_KEY=your_rime_api_key

# Block/Goose (if using)
BLOCK_GOOSE_API_KEY=your_goose_api_key
```

### Running the Application

1. Use our all-in-one demo script
```bash
chmod +x demo.sh
./demo.sh
```

Or run services individually:

1. Start Temporal server (in a separate terminal)
```bash
npm run dev:temporal
```

2. Start the worker (in a separate terminal)
```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

3. Start the API server (in a separate terminal)
```bash
npm run dev:api
```

4. Access the Web UI
```bash
open http://localhost:3000
```

5. Trigger a test incident
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/alarm -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"AlarmName": "high-cpu-usage"}'
```

## Interactive Web Dashboard

The FlowPilot web dashboard provides a real-time view of your incident response system:

- **Incident Monitoring**: View all current and past incidents
- **AI Decision Tracking**: See what decisions were made for each alert
- **Visualization**: View system diagrams of affected components
- **Voice Playback**: Listen to voice alerts directly in the browser
- **Quick Actions**: Trigger test alerts to see the system in action
- **Integration Status**: See which sponsor integrations are active

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000 when the API server is running.

## Testing

To test FlowPilot without external dependencies, you can:

1. Use the test script
```bash
npm run test
```

2. Or directly call the workflow
```bash
npx ts-node src/test.ts
```

## Demo Scenarios

For hackathon demonstrations, I've prepared several scenarios:

1. **High CPU Usage**: Simulates a service with excessive CPU consumption
2. **Memory Leak**: Demonstrates the system detecting and remedying a memory leak
3. **API Failure**: Shows how the system handles connectivity issues
4. **MCP/A2A Protocol Demo**: Demonstrates agent-to-agent communication

Run a full demo with `./demo.sh` and select option 5.
